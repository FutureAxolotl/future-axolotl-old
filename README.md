# future-axolotl

This is the official website of [Future_Axolotl](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJM-5SCaGBNwXAH7Mw7r8VQ)(me), which I use to tell a little bit about myself, give links to my stuff, and show current events going on in my community. The colorscheme of the website is the same as the colorscheme of his latest rice. It is set up to be deployed through [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Find it at https://future-axolotl.herokuapp.com.
