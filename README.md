# future-axolotl

NOTE: This website is down because Heroku removed their free teir (and it was kind of overkill to use Ruby on Rails for this), so I am currently making a new website with Svelte to be deployed on either [Adaptable](https://adaptable.io) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
This is the official website of [Future_Axolotl](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJM-5SCaGBNwXAH7Mw7r8VQ) (me), which I use to tell a little bit about myself, give links to my stuff, and show current events going on in my community. The colorscheme of the website is the same as the colorscheme of my latest rice. It is set up to be deployed through [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). Find it at https://future-axolotl.herokuapp.com.
